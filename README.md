## Description 
This Web Application is a Text editor that saves what you write. <br>
When you come back it it a couple days later the editor looks as if you had just left. <br>
This App is for those who want to write something and then walk away. <br>
Not like the way we walk away from our notes app. <br>
More like leaving the tv on and coming back a week later. <br>
I grew to really like that as I was working on this app. <br>
My OG repository was https://github.com/magjoker/ROOM-ON-FIRE <br>
I'm not sure what was going on with that repo but webpack would work sometimes and not others. <br>
I decided to make a new repository and rewatch Kayvonâ€™s guide. Shoutout to Kayvon! <br>
You can check out the app out here https://earth-wind-fire.herokuapp.com/
